# Dicom anonymizer app
This is a project that I started trying to create an anonymization app without the use of python and with a better look compared to what is already available but I did not managed to finish it yet so it might have some bugs or missing features.

### Notice
Use this software at your own risk, no guarantees are made. Please check your results and report any issues. It is not capable of detecting burnt-in information in the pixel data or overlays. 

Readme will be updated in the future.

- Zip and also a setup.exe are available for windows only.

The app allows the user to anonymize dicom files. In the future whole directory anonymization should be available.

### Run
Clone the repo and run
```{code-cell} bash
npm install
npm run start

```
